console.log('js loaded')
// So to me the parameter is sort of like having an acre of land and the argument is what you send into the acre of land 
// but you don't go before or over your acrage. 

// 2.Console.log is the function that sends the message and return is what we put to define the output. Ex, listing the 
// alphabet in ordere but asking in return the vowels only.

// 3. You run the risk of running a loop and not receiving a return.

function calculateCube(num1){
    return(num1*num1*num1)
}
console.log(calculateCube(5));
