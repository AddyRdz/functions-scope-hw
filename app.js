1. Parameters is the value received by the function while an argument is the value that is passed to the function. 
So to me the parameter is sort of like having an acre of land and the argument is what you send into the acre of land 
but you don't go before or over your acrage. 

2.Console.log is the function that sends the message and return is what we put to define the output. Ex, listing the 
alphabet in ordere but asking in return the vowels only.

3. You run the risk of running a loop and not receiving a return.
